# Tech Used
- node 16.17
- vite with react-ts template
- react with typescript

# To Run
- **use node 16.17 or greater**
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

# Proposed future enhancements
- Add support for decimal entries (currently only supports whole numbers)
- Add support for more than 1 operation at a time (currently can only add, subtract, divide or multiply 2 numbers). In the future could build a more complex function and then execute it.
- Turn buttons into separate components
- Handle clearing state better. Currently first clear is for the entry and then the second clear removes all operations for a re-start
- Handle the storage of the operations better. The array works for now, but seems like it could be done much better.
